# ActiveCache

Welcome to active_cache! This RubyGem helps you to save Database access performance by caching the result of ActiveRecord object.

when you get object via ActiveRecord, the result is stored on Memcached, then the data is fetched from Memcached, insted of Database when you access the same data at second time.

```ruby
# At the first time, ActiveRecord will access to Database.
# On this time, the result data is stored on Memcached.
user = User.find(1)
# => User Load (0.3ms)  SELECT  `users`.* FROM `users` WHERE `users`.`id` = 1 LIMIT 1

# At the second time, data is fetched from Memcached, so you can improve performance!
user = User.find(1)
# => ActiveRecord does not access to Database
```


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'active_cache'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install active_cache

## Usage

ActiveCache is deactive by default, so you need to activate  in your target Model like below.

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  self.activate_cache(true)
end
```

**Currently this RubyGem supports `find` method. Other features are comming soon, like has_many or belongs_to.**

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.

Then, create database as following.

```
$ mysql -u root -p
$ CREATE DATABASE active_cache_test CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;
```

Then, run `bin/spec` to run the tests.

You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
